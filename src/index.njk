        ðŸ‘‹ Hey, welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ“– About me I've had a passion for
        computers since I was a kid. I first stumbled into coding when I was
        about 10 years old and my dad, who owned a web marketing agency,
        introduced me to HTML. I started teaching myself to build websites using
        W3Schools and soon began working on projects for my dad's company. After
        high school, I joined the Colorado Army National Guard, where I served
        for 6 years. I was honorably discharged in July, 2023. That same month,
        I began Parsity.io, a full stack web development bootcamp. Since then, I
        have been building frontend and backend projects using JavaScript,
        TypeScript, React + Redux, and Node.js. ðŸ”§ What I'm working on... I have
        built a number of projects in vanilla JavaScript, React, and React +
        Redux. I'm most interested in backend development, unit testing, and
        system design. Currently, I'm building a full stack construction
        management application with Express and React. On the side, I'm learning
        Rust and working on websites as a freelancer. You can check out my
        pinned projects to see some of the things I've built that I'm most proud
        of.
